# Medical-Data-Insights-

I'm excited to share the journey of my recent SQL project, where I conducted a comprehensive analysis of medical data. The ability to extract meaningful insights from large datasets demonstrates the incredible power of SQL. Here's a snapshot of the project:

📊 Key Queries and Results:

1️⃣ Patients by Gender:

Identified and displayed the first name, last name, and gender of male patients. This basic query set the foundation for deeper analysis.
2️⃣ Patients without Allergies:

Analyzed the patient landscape by presenting the first and last names of individuals with no recorded allergies. This is crucial information for healthcare providers.
3️⃣ Patients with Names Starting with 'C':

Examined patient demographics by extracting the first names of individuals whose names begin with 'C'. This simple filtering query was quite effective.
4️⃣ Weight Ranges Query:

Investigated weight distribution by retrieving the first and last names of patients within the 100 to 120 weight range. This data is valuable for assessing patient health.
5️⃣ Allergies Update:

Enhanced data quality by updating the patients table to replace null values in the allergies column with 'NKA' (No Known Allergies). This improved data reliability.
... and the exploration continued with many other insightful queries!

🧠 Lessons Learned:

🔄 Data Manipulation Mastery:

Improved skills in updating records, handling NULL values, and ensuring data consistency.
🤝 Table Joins and Relationships:

Perfected the skill of joining tables to reveal relationships within the dataset, essential for comprehensive analysis.
📈 Complex Aggregations:

Managed complex aggregations, like calculating patient height sums and identifying patients with multiple admissions for the same diagnosis.
🌐 Future Steps:

🎓 Continuous Learning:

Eager to deepen my SQL knowledge, exploring advanced techniques and optimizations.
🚀 Real-world Applications:

Excited to apply these skills in real-world scenarios, contributing to impactful data-driven decisions.
This project was an incredible learning experience, showcasing the power of SQL in extracting and analyzing medical data to drive informed healthcare decisions.
